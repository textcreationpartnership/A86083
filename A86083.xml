            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hrice noble and much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Citizens, Give me leave to preſent to you that prayer which Chriſt preſented to all Chriſtians. The more enemies it hath found, in the Name of Chriſt Ieſus, the more I beg of you to countenance it, and befriend it. Though ſome in theſe ſad times have underprized our high calling, yet none must doubt to call this our <hi>Lords Prayer:</hi> Religion is at a low ebbe, when Gods Miniſters and Chriſts own Prayer is little or nought ſet by. Juſtly have we been puniſhed, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous O Lord art thou in all thy works:
<pb facs="tcp:119880:3"/>yet what ever we ſuffer, I beſeech you in the name of God and Chriſt, to be the Patron of this Prayer; which among ſome cal'd Chriſtians hath found as many ſcorners as Chriſt its maker among the Jewes: mockers, when you ſpeak to God, ere you end, be pleaſed, thus to pray, <hi>Mat. 6.</hi> and this to ſay, <hi>Luk. 11.</hi> The one Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt regiſtring the Rule to pray by, that other recording the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our prayers: and both inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating thus much to all ages, if we lay by this prayer, we loſe the rule to pray by: if we ſay not this prayer, we miſſe much, if not moſt our Chriſt commanded us to pray for.</p>
            <p>I will not trouble your religious ears with thoſe horrid profane ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos uttered, and in publick againſt this pious prayer.</p>
            <p>It's no wonder to me Chriſts own prayer hath ſo many enemies, where the Devils Doctrine hath ſo many faſt friends. But this is condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:119880:3"/>that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than light, falſhood than truth, and a fantaſtick Enthuſiaſme, more than Chriſts own Orizon.</p>
            <p>I deſire rather to pity than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the brain-ſick Humouriſts of our times, whoſe diſloyall cenſures, like diſloyall ſubjects, have ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed their ſupreme Soveraign, the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> the Son of God. The cauſe, becauſe he preſcribed this ſet form of prayer: and hence it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the ſpirit is ſtinted, for that the matter and form preſcribed.</p>
            <p>But have you not heard how he who had a larger portion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit than all living, who thought it no robbery to be equall with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> prayed three times, and every time uſed the ſelf ſame words—Let his precept there,<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 11.2.</note> his practiſe<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> there, encourage your worſhipfull ſociety to patronize this book of Prayer: nay, the
<pb facs="tcp:119880:4"/>very name of your Abide ſhall make me more confide; as God hath placed you in ſuch an Eden, who knowes but it's to protect this Prayer which came out of the Paradiſe, the Breaſt of our Meſsias? your earthly Lot is faln to you in a fair ſoyle, while the plat of ground you inhabit is <hi>P. N. R.</hi> as in that Row you have a corporall reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſo you ſhall not want a true Beadſman to be earneſt with God at your end, you may live for ever in his Boſome from whence came this prayer, a prayer I beſeech you, oft to iterate, for a ſpeedy poſt, which will convey and in a trice all your ſupplicats to your great Maſter, God Almighty. A rare preparation, which fits you for your paſſage from <hi>Egypt</hi> unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> In a word, this prayer is that ſalt which ſeaſons all your underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. Nor do I attribute this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to the bare outward ſaying your <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> but as being joyned with the hearts ſincerity; nor would I the
<pb facs="tcp:119880:4"/>outward form <hi>totidem verbis</hi> to be neglected: for know't, as thou maiſt be an hypocrite, and do God all bodily ſervice, ſo thou canſt never be a good Chriſtian, and deny to do it. I would you therefore exerciſe this ſet form of prayer, to ſhew you are no Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts; to joyne alſo with your voice the ſpirit of underſtanding, to ſhew you are good Chriſtians. That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 11</note> of Chriſt, ſhall be your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to go down to this his forge to ſharpen your blunted goads and mattocks.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not this as a deſpiſer of them, have the gift of making a prayer: that I ſay is to comfort ſuch as have a mean portion of the gift of prayer. It's may purpoſe then not to pick a quarrell, but prevent a duell, and tell you what is juſtifiable, a ſet form, not to implead to pray as the ſpirit moves, ſo be joyned with it the ſpirit of underſtanding.</p>
            <p>To conclude, our Chriſt his precept
<pb facs="tcp:119880:5"/>hath made this Prayer legitimate, and when we pray, let us underſtand what's that we pray, and this ſhall ſtop the mouthes of all oppugners. I will add a widowes mite to this work, by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending once more this prayers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding to your protection; which if not, for love to me, who owns nought, to merit at you hands; yet for the honour of Chriſt, I doubt not but you will accept of the tendered ſervice of</p>

            <p>Thou prayedſt to thy Father for us: Thou preachedſt to us how we ſhould pray to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not as we will, but as thou haſt wil'd; thou teacheſt
<pb facs="tcp:119880:8"/>us what to ſay, and we are bound to ſay thy prayer; Thou haſt taught us how to pray, ſo ties us not at all times to the ſame words. O thou wiſdome of the Father, let me learn wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from thy lips; Who to furniſh the meanest of<note n="*" place="margin">In Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> men, preſcribes them a Plat-forme, who ſo ſets down a plat-form, as licenſes the more gifted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their gift of prayer.</p>
            <p>Thy prayer, O Chriſt, is not given to ſtint the ſpirit, thy prayer is lent to ſupport it. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be thou my God and my Chriſt, who haſt not only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us to be cal'd <hi>Gods Sons,</hi> but taught us to ſay, <hi>Our Farther</hi>—</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:119880:9"/>
            <p> Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I give over thy prayer, I honour its Author, I reverence its matter, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire its method; it was made by Chriſt God, made by Chriſt for man, uſefull for all men; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could ſo much be contained in ſo narrow a room, but that of Gods making, the Sons pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Holy Ghoſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring. Let the Enthuſiaſts ſlight it, the <hi>fratra cilli</hi> lay it by, as men conceiving they are come to an <hi>acme</hi> of perfection, yet ſuch as fail I finde in the beſt of my expreſſions, that let them be the <hi>protaſis,</hi> this ſhall be the <hi>apodoſis;</hi> and if with my own I begin, with our
<pb facs="tcp:119880:9"/>Lords<note n="*" place="margin">Prayers.</note> I deſire to make an end; the Lords Prayer is the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of all things neceſſary, and when I have prayed for all I can, in this as in a glaſſe, my Chriſt lets me ſee the face of all my deſires: while I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding this ſacred Prayer, Lord let thy ſacred Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend down upon me, ſo ſhall thy Name be honoured, and I inabled to diſcharge this great work I have in hand. O thou who madeſt this prayer, make me underſtand its meaning; and while I am in hand with this work, blow the ſpark of my meditations into a flame, let my paraphraſe be ſet <hi>Carbo &amp; lampas,</hi> a light ſhinning, and
<pb facs="tcp:119880:10"/>lamp burning; by this light, guide babes in knowledge on to a ſet form of prayer, by it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all Hereticks who deny a ſet form of prayer. O my Chriſt I will ſhut up my too much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpeech to thee with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of thee, who art all in all unto us all; bread to feed us, wine to cheriſh us, the white robe to cover us; thou haſt ſlain our ſins by thy paſſion, quickned us to a life of grace by thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, provided a manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us by thy Aſcenſion: we may enter in, for thou art the door; no danger by the way, for our Christ is the way; we can have no better aſſurance then from him is the truth; nor let
<pb facs="tcp:119880:10"/>us fear the ſting of death, for we are ſervants to the Lord of life, to him who is the way, the truth, and the life. O my Saviour, I bleſſe God for thee, I glory in thee, I caſt my ſelf upon thee, upon the bended knee of my body I beg thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, praying in thy own words ſaying thy own Prayer:</p>

            <p>O All heavenly Prayer, the very language of the Lord Jeſus, the Chriſtian<note n="*" place="margin">A good Word till abuſed.</note> Directory, The Rubricks Epitomy, ſhort in words, copious in matter, which gives God his Due, begs all needfull for us all: all thy precious petitions, it is my every daies prayer, may be writ with the pen of a Diamond in my heart. O Divine Prayer, I am pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to give thee every morning the viſit, every night to hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with thee; the firſt to ſalute, the laſt to take my leave of. Thou haſt taught me to bleſſe God, my here welfare, my hereafter happineſſe; what to ſeek, a Kingdome; how to enſure it, by doing what thou wilt, as thou wilt. O moſt holy prayer, which ſuites
<pb facs="tcp:119880:11"/>God for us all, and for all needfull, which teaches us how to unravell our debts and diſcharge them, to prevent ſin by praying againſt ſin; yea prayes in the midſt of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations for ſafe deliverance. Thou art <hi>magnum in parvo,</hi> yet ſayeſt little; yet when we have ſaid all we can, we can ſay no more. I admire thy brevity, ſhort yet ſweet, few words, yet full as the Patriarchs ſacks: underſtood we at length what thou comprehendeſt in ſhort, we would every day lengthen our eſteem of thee, leſſen our opinion of our own barren expreſſions. But I am ſorry thou art ſo ſlighted by thoſe who think themſelves none<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch, and for my part I would be very ſorry to be ſuch as they are—O moſt ſacred Prayer, whither wilt thou go, the Enthuſiaſt his haſty conceptions will be thy death; the Sectarian Miniſter, for fear of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſpleaſure, is feared to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:119880:12"/>thee in the Pulpit, yet thou haſt one faſt friend, the orthodox conformiſt, who hath bid thee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come home to his houſe, and ſhames not to walk with thee to Church. He prayes in thy Dialect; and when he uſes other words, Saying the, thou epitomizeſt all he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The orthodox Conformiſt is thy faſt friend; the unſtable Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick a friend in ſummer; the old Heretick at all times at oddes with thee. But let who will deſpiſe thee, I will honour thee, I will honour thy Author, I will give due honour to thy divine matter; thou art part of Gods Word compoſed by Chriſt who is the Word: and every of thy words are of weight. This conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, who can deny it, but our Lords Prayer hath had hard meaſure? God forgive them, who for popular ends have laid thee by; God open their eyes, who preferre
<pb facs="tcp:119880:12"/>their own before our Lords Prayer: God give us Conformiſts grace ſo to ſay our Lords Prayer, that we may have all, in it, granted; even for his ſake grant it good Lord, who made it, who taught it, who left it for us to learn; it is our Saviour hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to ſay it; it is a Chriſtians duty to doe it; he is an Atheiſt that doth deny it: I will uſe it for my pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to pray by, for a platforme, and ſay it, not as tyed by it from all other prayers, not at all times lay it by, but ſometimes I will borrow all its words, ſometimes pray to the ſame ſenſe; now making it my rule, anon all the petitions of my prayer. And thus O ſacred prayer, I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoile my ſoul from all ſuperſtitious conceipts of thee, as alſo from the leaſt diſreſpect of thee: and while I uſe my own words, I will binde me to thy method; and when I take not that large, I will quit my ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Supplication</hi> is a prayer framed to

            <p>A prayer whoſe conciſeneſſe doth demonſtrate, that our God ſtands in no need to be cryed on from morning until noon; as was <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.26.</p>
            <p>Behold as an exceeding ſhort, ſo a moſt fecund or fruitfull prayer; and at large, it highly extolls its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,

            <p>Secondly, There is neither good we want, nor evill that we would be freed from, but here we pray ſor't; for God to give us the one, remove far from us the other: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nico verbo,</hi> in one word, here is involved, what good every man ſtands in need of: again, all the evill of all men, with a boon to be delivered from it.</p>

            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, we ſhould not have has <hi>Zebedees</hi> wife ſo impudent, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her prayer ſhe had placed ſuch a preface, ſhe would have been lowlier minded, if ſhe had minded that the higheſt heaven had been Gods habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Man, it's the nature of him, and he learnt it of a woman, to be too ſawcy in his ſuit, and more to aime at his own honour, than Gods glory.</p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Gadarens</hi> for the loſſe of their Hogs, could not have been ſo clowniſhly uncivil, but have uſed better words to our Jeſus, had they praeput ſuch a preface as this.</p>
            <p>The ignorance of what God is, makes mean man unmannerly, and petition Gods departure, rather then his preſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon, this preface had need be ſaid, for that, in this time we have time to recollect our whole ſoule, and minde, and ſpirit to pray. O conſideration doth well

            </p>
            <p>For the firſt word <hi>Father</hi> puts us in minde of 4 things;
<list>
                  <item>1. Of the love of God.</item>
                  <item>2. His commiſerating compaſſion.</item>
                  <item>3. His fear that we fall.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, For Gods love to man, I may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſay of it, as was ſaid of Chriſt to <hi>Lazarus, Lord how thou lovedſt him! Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> admires, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>Jonathans</hi> falls far ſhort of it, though his love did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the love of women, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26.</p>
            <p>But come, <hi>Can a woman forget her owne childe?</hi> The Quaere implies a poſſibility, but a rarity; yet it's aver'd, <hi>the Lord will never leave us nor forſake us.</hi> And thus the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall love of the mother, the faithfull love of friends, the love of God to us ſurpaſſes; it parallels it ſelf with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119880:19"/>Chriſts to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who ſhewed then his love unto him, when he unable to do him a pleaſure, when he dead and in grave, when he ſtunk in the grave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Lord how unutterable is thy love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all us thy ſons and daughters!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, This term or title, <hi>Father,</hi> puts us in hopes of Gods commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating compaſſion. <hi>O he pities our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed eſtate, that the patrimony he gave us prodigals, is ſpent; that we who are his, are forc'd to feed on husks and akorns; that faln amongſt theeves, and what's left is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us: O how his bowels yern within his belly, to ſee us ſo poor and needy and naked, not like that we were! it grieves him to ſee us ſo ill like; but moſt, that we in miſery, and yet the fondlings make no matter of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God is our Father, and it inſures us how fear'd he is we fall,
<list>
                  <item>1. Apparent by his injunction ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the Angels to pitch their tents about us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7.</item>
                  <item>2. By his paſſing by our elder<note n="*" place="margin">Angels.</note> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who had faln, but we having faln, he ſent his own Son to help us up again.</item>
               </list>

            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:119880:19"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>O God the greater hath been our miſery, the more cauſe we have to admire thy mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, God is cald our Father, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which inſures us how ready he is to help us, that are faln. If a childe ſhould chance to fall into a pond, you need not, if his parent know of it, wiſh him to go and help him, his bowels yern, his feet run, his hands he reaches out, to lay hold on his babe. God who is Father of us all, alwaies knowes our miſchances, he needs be told by none, bid by none go help us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The truth is, our help ſtandeth in the Lord our God, who made both heaven and earth, and bleſſed be his name world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, God is our Father, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as it puts us in hopes of his love, compaſſion, fear we fall, beſt help; ſo the title bindes us to do all is beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be done to a Father, nought elſe.</p>
            <p>It's inquired what is that
<list>
                  <item>1. Aske him bleſſing.</item>
                  <item>2. Do him reverence.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The title, <hi>Father,</hi> adviſeth us to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119880:20"/>crave Gods bleſſing: <hi>O,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eſau</hi> to <hi>Iſaae, father bleſſe me, even me alſo.</hi> He will not leave him till he bleſſe him, <hi>Eſau</hi> his earneſt ſuit ſhall teach me to make an high eſtimate of Gods bleſſing, yea, to eſteem of Gods bleſſing better than <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> golden Fleece,<note place="margin">He ſpeaks it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem he hath of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing above all elſe he wants.</note> or yet the great <hi>Chams,</hi> Tree full of Pearls hanging by cluſters.</p>
            <p>I ſtand in need of much, yet give me this, and beleeve me, I have got more than all elſe I want. Our little ones deſire twice a day our bleſſing, gentle monitors which in a ſtill voice ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us, to crave Gods bleſſing. God is our Father, we our childrens, we look they ſhould aske us bleſſing: as much God expects of us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The word <hi>Father</hi> puts us in mind we muſt behave our ſelves reverently towards God, and at two times in ſpeciall,
<list>
                  <item>When we ſpeak to God.</item>
                  <item>When God ſpeaks to us.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, I have oft admired of that carriage of <hi>Eliſha</hi> to <hi>Elias,</hi> who thus cryed out after him, <hi>O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my Father, the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof:</hi> If Gods good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

            <p>Firſt, our honourable additions, ſuch as Almighty and moſt merciful Father, it were well they were cald in to be witneſſes, when we ſpeak to God, that it's with all reverence.</p>
            <p>Again, let our reverence be made to appear by beſpeaking God in a low voice; the high God loves to be beſpoke in a low language, (<hi>cum plurima humilitate,</hi> with much humility.) When we ſpeak to him, let us take our termes with us, when of our ſelves, ſay as did the Prophet, <hi>I am a worm and no man:</hi> as did the Patriarch, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſum Domine,</hi> I am leſſe a Lord than the leaſt of thy mercies.</p>
            <p>God our Father cannot abide to hear us his ſons and daughters mouth the word <hi>Merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me tell thee and truly, he that will tell God he deſerves heaven, God will do him no more but juſtice, yet reward him with hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my own part,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> I had rather cry when I pray, God be mercifull to me a ſinner, then to brave it out, Lord, I am not as this Publican: yea, and by profeſſing of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritleſſe,

            <p n="2">2. You muſt reverence God your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaking to you, this he doth ſo oft as we do: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, We are Gods Embaſſadors, and God intreats you by us; whileſt you hear us preach the word of God, God expects you hear it with all reverence, as words proceeding forth of his own lips: and yet we have a ſort, who neither the four and twenty Elders, who vaild their Crowns and laid them at his feet; nor yet the Abiſſines, who pull off the ſhooes in the Church-porch as they go in, can move them to come mannerly into Gods houſe the Church to hear him.</p>

            <p>God generally is all our Fathers, firſt by creating us.</p>

            <p>Singularly, God is Chriſts Father, no ſo ours, as his, for Chriſt is his eternall off-ſpring without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:119880:22"/>
            <p> Now we ſee here why not Chriſt, but Chriſtians ſay this prayer, for that God is our Father, not as his.</p>
            <p>Secondly, why the adopted ſaints ſay Our Father, for that they are all his adopted children.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, why we admit even of the moſt wicked with us, to ſay our Lords prayer, for that he is Father of good and bad, all our Fathers by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>All the world by creation, have a like relation unto God, and may call him our Father.</p>
            <p>All ſanctified Saints have a more nigh tie to God; and may call him our Father, by creation, by adoption, yet more then the elect in ſpeciall, or the world in generall, may Chriſt ſay, and call God, my Father, not by creation, not by adoption, but by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p>Straight then is the tye of God the Father to Chriſt his Son, for Gods naturall Son.</p>
            <p>Next is the relation of the Saint to God, who is his Father by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The moſt remote relation is that of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119880:22"/>the wicked to God, who is called their father, for that he made them, ſo did he the beaſts of the field, and fowls of the air. All then this word, <hi>our,</hi> our Father, as uſed by the wicked, can put them in hope of, is Gods generall providence, to provide for them as his other creatures.</p>
            <p>That which the word, <hi>our,</hi> our Father, as uſed by the elect, ought to put us in hopes of, is Gods ſpeciall providence, that he will be with us to deliver us out of all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>The word, <hi>our,</hi> our Father, as uſed by the elect in ſpeciall, world in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, not by Chriſt in particular, proteſts, he that is our Father, yet he is Chriſts Father, after a more miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner, than any other.</p>

            </p>
            <p>O how doth prayer link us on earth to the God of heaven; makes us, of as nigh alliance, as father and ſon, own father and own ſon.</p>

            <p>For the firſt, this word, <hi>Art,</hi> is <hi>vox loquentis,</hi> the ſound, or voice of one ſpeaking to another, not of another, but to another. And now ſince the party ſpeaking is man, the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken, God; ſince it's man that prayes, God that is prayed to; ſince man goes not about to get to Gods ſpeech, by Angels or Saints; but at firſt Gods ſelf is ſpoke to, which is apparent by this, <hi>Art,</hi> this ſhewes the priviledge of ſuch as live! within the pale of the Church;<note place="margin">Note.</note> We may all of us have free acceſſe to God himſelf: <hi>Moſes</hi> had he been alive, would have depoſed it.

            <p>For the firſt, the place of Gods abode, it is Heaven: <hi>God our Father</hi> thou art in Heaven.</p>
            <p>That Gods our father, it ſhewes his willingneſſe to help us.</p>
            <p>That he is in Heaven, it ſhewes his ableneſſe to help us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have viewed the Preface from</hi> Dan to Beerſheba, <hi>from one end to the other; and it tells me, he that would get good! by prayer, muſt be perſwaded, God is both willing and able to help him: if he were willing, not able, alas his wiſhes could doe me no good; if he were able and not willing, all his might were not worth a mite to me: Now that he is both willing and able, I am ſure he will do for me all he can; and it's enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou mean to be bettered by prayer, come not deſpairing neither of Gods <hi>Will,</hi> nor <hi>Can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I read of a couple, the one doubting of Gods willingneſſe, the other of his ableneſſe: <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 2. ſaith the Leper <hi>Maſter if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean. Mar.</hi> 9.22. The man whoſe ſon was poſſeſt, ſaid, <hi>If thou canſt do any thing for us, help us.</hi>

            <p>Now will I ſpeak of Gods place of abode, <hi>a parte poſt, diviſim,</hi> as led to it by the laſt word in this Preface, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Our Father,</hi> it's thou we pray to, <hi>who art in Heaven:</hi> I will make this my method, give you,

            <p>I finde only theſe 8 acceptations of Heaven in the holy Bible, and though one be but meant, I will give you two to make choice of, far diſtant, both ſignificant; the one<note n="*" place="margin">Above.</note>

               <hi>infra;</hi> the one the place of the Church triumphant, the other the myſticall ſubject of the Church militant: firſt, then by Heaven may be meant the ſeat of the bleſſed, that majeſticall place of magnificence, as I may ſo ſay, Gods chief Mannor Houſe in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</p>
            <p>Or if you minde not to look ſo high, you have nigher at hand an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: the righteous Saints on earth, they are the Temple of the living God, yea, and he dwels in them and walks in them: here it is God dwels, theſe are his Temples, Gods houſe above is Heaven; and his Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the Saints.</p>
            <p>The letter makes us ſubſcribe to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119880:27"/>the firſt expoſition; the Spirit cauſes our acknowledgement of the ſecond; Dame Nature hath ſet her hand to the one, its the Lady Grace perſwades us to confeſſe this other.</p>

               <hi>Well while I acknowledge the ſenſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> I will not let paſſe the ſenſe myſticall,</hi> viz. <hi>that by Heaven may be meant the elect on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor wants there ſome ſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Saints, and Heaven: they ſhine, <hi>ſicut luminaria in mundo,</hi> and as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens lend us light, ſo are the Saints will'd to let their light ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore men: and <hi>ut ſol in Coelo, ſic mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di in mundo;</hi> as the Sun is the lighteſt part of Heaven, ſo of theſe ſaies our Saviour, <hi>Vos eſtis lux mundi,</hi> Ye are the light of the world: the Death of theſe, is like the Suns Eclipſe, the Life of theſe, that high noon, or Sun at height, which is a guide to all that are not blinde,</p>
            <p>O ye Saints, The radiant rayes of

            <p>But come, what may theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations put us in minde of?</p>
            <p>The firſt of ſomething which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of ſomething which concerns our ſelves.</p>

            <p>By Heaven likewiſe may be meant, us men in whom God dwels, as in an houſe;<note place="margin">Extract.</note> O what ones then behoves it us to be? The wicked are the Devils houſe to which he is return'd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.

            <p>And yet to conſider how we let
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119880:28"/>this manſion houſe of Gods, in the Iſle Man lies full of Mamholes, we may be aſhamed of it; in very deed we let all lie forlorne. To pleaſe our friends againſt they come, we make all trim, Lord, why ſhould we not do as much to pleaſe the Lord? And yet in every corner of that Hall, Heart, you may ſpie an aſh-heap of evill imaginations:<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> That back room Memory, is fill'd with old ill done deeds: That upper room Judgement, with error and hereſie: Thoſe out houſes, Ears, are fil'd with rubbiſh of newes; State newes, what done in Court, Countrey newes, how rules price of Corn, ribauldry newes, obſcene ſongs; our Eyes are full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, our Tongues full of deceit: and now while neither in-room, nor out-room, ſoul nor body is trim'd up, nor cleanſed, how can the Lord take delight to dwell in us?</p>

            <p>Now I purpoſe, <hi>Deo juvante,</hi> God enabling, to ſpeak upon that poſt-put and firſt of the Petitions: and in brief, to make this my method to take notice of:
<list>
                  <item>1 Their Diviſion.</item>
                  <item>2 Their Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</item>
                  <item>3 Their Order.</item>
                  <item>4 Their Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</item>
                  <item>5 Subject matter mued up in each Petition.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, for their Diviſion, they are of two ſeverall ſorts or kindes: the firſt ſort of them concern God. Second, our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for Equality, they are three and three; three concern God, and three man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for Order, this order is obſerved, Gods three precede mans, mans three come behinde Gods; ours are ſet after his, his before ours.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, their Precedency prayes us to take a view of each particular Petition, as ſet before one another.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, their matter makes us privie to what is begged of God in each of theſe petitions in ſpeciall.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, theſe Petitions are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two ſorts: Firſt ſort or kinde are divine, and caſt a glance at
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119880:29"/>Heaven. The ſecond ſort are humane, and caſt a glance at earth: firſt looks at God, the other at us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now this Diviſion implies an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Three Extracts.</note> and that when we ſend out our ſupplications abroad, we let them walk hand in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such a compound ſhould be our Prayers, Petitions, ſharing out requeſts meet for God and us joyntly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By this Diviſion we are taught, man was not made for himſelf, he is to pray as well for Gods glory, as his own good; many remember themſelves, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God, in their prayers; few remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber God, but themſelves, in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. A Sect here found fault with, A platform, which teaches them a better leſſon: yea, this diviſion of theſe Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into two ſorts or kindes; the one concerning God, the other us: tels us,
<q>That who prayes aright muſt pray for Gods glory, as well as for his own good.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thing this Diviſion informes us of, is, that as diſcords make the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt harmony; ſo prayers ſound beſt in Gods ears, which conſiſt of ſharps and flats, riſings and fallings, which are now, <hi>in alto,</hi> as high as Heaven, Anon <hi>in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119880:29"/>Baſſe,</hi> as low as earth. I mean prayers conſiſting of two parts; Gods glory who lives above, Mans good who dwels below: he that would avoid the name of ſimple, muſt make his prayer a compound of theſe two ſeverall ſorts of ſimples. <hi>And thus while God and he meet in prayer, it's my hopes they ſhall do the like in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There go at leaſt two things to make up whatſoever is, Matter, and Form; and it's not one but two joyn together to procreate this prayer, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Divine, Humane,</hi> God and man muſt be in conjunction, that as for matter, ſo for form, a right prayer may be brought out, it muſt bear in its front, the Image of God and us. <hi>And therefore he that hath made a prayer, and not praiſed God, hath produced a body without life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that praiſes God, never praies at all for himſelf, gives a form to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Single petitions for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only, or for Mans good alone, are no better then <hi>Zeuxis</hi> Berries, they have a being, but imaginary: A right pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is produced whoſe form is Gods praiſe, whoſe matter is mans neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:119880:30"/>
            <p> Well, I am reſolved while I pray for my ſelf to remember God in my prayers, and while I beg, God may be honoured, to crave ſomewhat, for my ſelf, He cannot wiſh anothers hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, that wils not his own wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: nor is there hopes that man ſhall fare well at Gods hands, who forgets to give God his honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A paſſage,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> which I proteſt ſhall cauſe me to poiſe my prayers in even ſcales and hang them even betwixt heaven and earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing worth your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is the Equality of theſe two ſorts or kindes of Petitions. They are three and three; three concerning God, three concerning man; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for God and his glory, as man and his good; as many for man and his good, as God and his glory: here are petitions as even divided, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as the Iſraelites had their Manna, none have too much, none too little, each alike, alike pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; God and man the like meaſure number, while three belong to God, three to man.<note place="margin">Three Extracts.</note>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Heaven will not be behinde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119880:30"/>but what reſpect we who are but earth, offer God, God gives leave of requitall unto us. <hi>O Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty worthy to be admired, when Gods Son proffers as much kindneſſe to us mortals, as we mortals tender the immortall God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That ſecondly I ſurrender up to the uſe of your remembrance, is, Gods readineſſe to repay, for parity no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can we ingage our ſelves to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, but God is as oft in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to recompenſe: and if we come with our requeſt for the advancement of Gods glory, he will allow us to put in another, for our benefit. <hi>A paſſage I profeſſe ſhall make me give God more, ſince I may get as much.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. This licenſe or leave for our Petitions to equalize Gods avows, Chriſt who pen'd this prayer, had one eye looking about how to help us, as the other how God ſhould be honoured.</item>

            <p>The even number proclaims Chriſts dear love he bore as the Creator ſo the creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O my God and my Chriſt,<note place="margin">A Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium.</note> let me weigh thy affections beyond deſert, while my deſert doth merit no parallell with thy Father.</hi>

            <p> I now come to the third thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in theſe petitions, and that is their order, how theſe petitions are ſet down.</p>
            <p>The three which concern God firſt, our three are ſet down after: <hi>Ride on O Lord with thy honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt triumphant entrance, it's Gods; the Trumpetters blaze this, are his three firſt petitions, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, ours follow; what ſhall it teach us nought? doubtleſſe leſſons worth our learning.</p>

This order for priority proteſts,<note place="margin">Two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</note> firſt thing God hath a care of, is his honour: himſelf ſaies, <hi>My honour I will not give to another.</hi> He is <hi>Lucifers</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would enthronize himſelf in Gods honour: an <hi>Haman,</hi> hanging is too good for him, that thinks himſelf worthy the Kings honour: we have a ſort of proud <hi>Hamans</hi> would be jet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>Ahaſhuerohs</hi> his cloathes of ſtate, a company of ſaucy beggers would be ſerved before their Maſter.</p>
            <p>But as a begger before he begs, bids God bleſſe Maſter and Miſtreſſe, and then asks his almes: ſo this great Maſter, God, is firſt to be bleſt; or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119880:31"/>poor man who comes naked into Gods Hall, ſhould dare to aske him any thing: thus if he doe, he is like to fare better; thus if not, God will not take it for well done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, this order of ſetting down the three Petitions, which concern Gods honour, firſt learns us a mean, how to obtain a Boon for our ſelves: Its thus, firſt by tendring God due reverence. <hi>Zebedees</hi> ſons had not learnt this manner, and it may be, miſt therefore what they would have had. A forethought for our ſeles, fixt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thought of Gods worſhip; It is the cauſe while we look at much we catch little. A worldling that will thrive, hath himſelf firſt in his thoughts. An heavenling that will get what he doth want, God is firſt in his minde, and on his tongue end. A ſpirituall bankrupt then breaks, when he doth aim to receive all before he doth disburſe ought. <hi>Well I will pray my God to accept of a talent of worſhip, or I will dare to petition him for a fee-farm of eternity, his praiſes I will place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they will make room in his preſence for thoſe needy ones, my petitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:119880:32"/>
            <p> A poor man who hath noblemen to be his ſpokeſmen to his Prince, is in hopes to be heard.</p>
            <p>It's we who are poor, and needy, and naked; our noble ſpokeſmen who move the King of Heaven in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, are petitions commendatory of his Majeſty; after they be come in, who indeed are of a very nigh alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our Lord. Then our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince will be pleaſed to give us au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to read our petitions and ſubſign them: <hi>O that we would weigh this well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my own part,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> I will not forget, firſt to do God reverence, leſt my neglect, cauſe his after deniall of my ſuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, my method obliges me to ſpeak of theſe petitions precedency, as every one of theſe Petitions precede one another, I mean go before one another; we muſt begin with the firſt, hold on to the Jaſt; and ſee, if we can ſpie why thus Chriſt ſet theſe petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their places.</p>
            <p>In the firſt petition,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Petit.</note> we pray for the hallowing of Gods name. In brief that the name of the great God may be among us in high eſteem. This is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119880:32"/>it, is firſt taken care for, and firſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, to put us in minde.</p>
            <p>His name, its Honour,<note place="margin">Its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> he doth more ſet by then all elſe he hath; more than his Kingdome: Truth is, God weighs the honour of his name above a world of wealth: and therefore in the firſt petition, Gods name and its renown is firſt prayed for: then his Kingdome; but in the ſecond place in the ſecond petition, which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy Kingdome come:</hi> This is it we are commanded next to intercede for;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Petit.</note> that Gods Kingdome may come, and that before that Petition, <hi>Thy will be done:</hi> The cauſe,<note place="margin">Its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> becauſe here impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the will of God ſhould be done, till his kingdome of faithful ſubjects firſt flouriſh. Let God here firſt have his Church, and he ſhall then have his will: Hence it is, for it we firſt pray, and it coming among us, for by Gods Kingdome, may be meant Gods Kingdome of Grace, that is, his Church, conſiſting of a multitude of beleeving Chriſtians, till the King of Heaven have a Dominion of ſuch ſubjects on earth, there's no need to hope for, much leſſe to pray for, his will may
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119880:33"/>be done. Before a Prince come to ſway the Scepter, he may command and be withſtood, when his kingdome is come, his will ſhall be done. Thus authority muſt precede command, and a power over be had, or the precept be obeyed. An occaſion made Chriſt will we ſhould pray, firſt, for Gods regality, <hi>That his Kingdome may come,</hi> or he would a word to be ſpoke of it, <hi>That his will ſhould be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I come to the third Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in the Lords Prayer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Petit.</note> which is this, <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven:</hi> this third petition precedes that fourth, in which we pray for all things neceſſary for this life: now I ſay, this third hath prehemency of place before that fourth, and it is to certifie us, he that would have granted all neceſſaries for this life, muſt firſt with Chriſt ſaying pray, and praying ſay, <hi>Father, not my will but thy will be, done:</hi> The Petition, for begging abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do Gods will, is ſet before the petition for getting goods. A good monitour which ſhall make me,<note place="margin">Its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> to get what I want, to doe what God wils.</p>
            <p>By theſe petitions placing, I am
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119880:33"/>informed, the performance of Gods will, guides on to the attainment of whatſoever needfull for the life of man. This I am taught, while thus learnt to pray: firſt, <hi>Thy will be done;</hi> Then, <hi>Give us our daily Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I come to the fourth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for bodily ſuſtenance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>4.</hi> Petit.</note> which is ſet before our petitioning God for the remiſſion of ſins: nor can I for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain determine what ſhould be Chriſts meaning, in placing a petition for our bodily good, before the petitions for the remiſſion of the ſins of our ſouls; yet I verily imagine, to ſhew, he would have mans naturall life firſt ſupplyed with what needfull, and then ſet down what he ſhould crave to get a life God gave leave on its behalf, firſt to petition.</p>
            <p>Or elſe it may be Chriſt did it to detect what man moſt longed for, goods more than forgiveneſſe; we have a better appetite to Bread corporall, than ſpiritual, and love Meat more than Manna.<note place="margin">Its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> This petition then had this place ſigned perchance covertly, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, man is more ſenſible of bodily
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119880:34"/>want than of thoſe ſores, the ſins of his ſoul: and that he hath a greedier deſire to have this worldly goods, than to diſcharge his old debts, in which caſt by the default of <hi>Adam</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Well while I caſt my eye upon the ſituation of this petition, I will not forget what I am taught, when I come to ſuit God, moſt runneth in our mindes theſe bodies of ours, and the begging bodily neceſſaries, daily Bread for bodies ſuſtenance. But come, while I have ſeen Chriſt by placing this petition, picture out mans own minde, which runs upon the world, ſo by that which followes Chriſt tels me what man more needs, whileſt I in ſtead of this one petition for the body, Chriſt cauſes two peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be put upon his poor ſouls behalf.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which two but fift by deſcent,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Petit.</hi>
               </note> from the preface is this, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that,</hi> &amp;c. I am as yet to look at nought ſave this petitions precedency, it's ſet down before, <hi>And lead us not into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation:</hi> now the precedency of this petition to that following,<note place="margin">Its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> foreſhewes,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119880:34"/>it's neither the ſin which hangs on, nor hanging over; but what paſt, and commit, we are firſt to aske God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe for, what firſt perpetrated, God muſt firſt be petitioned to paſſe it by. The placing this petition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, implies it's ſin paſt moſt endamni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, more than either the marching on towards us of temptations, or the now le<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gre of evill luſts.</p>

               <hi>O my God,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> whileſt I cannot forget what I now do, I will call to minde what long ſince I have committed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the laſt petition hath none to precede,<note place="margin">6. <hi>Petit.</hi>
               </note> nor is it the leaſt for that the laſt placed, for in this laſt petition we beg a double boon, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from future and preſent evill. Thus what may ſeem by underſetting to be ſet light, for laſt, this laſt compriſes in it a double boon, that ſo it may have a like renown, or elſe perchance it poſſeſſes this place, that ever in this upſhot of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; we ſhould bear in minde what is the upſhot of this prayer, a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for preſervation, now the Lord preſerve us, and defend us. Again, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance this petition is laſt ſet down,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119880:35"/>which involves a duplicated requeſt, to teach us, As at the beginning, ſo even to the end of our prayers, we muſt be very earneſt with God in our ſuit.</p>
            <p>And now to period all theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, all and every of theſe petitions comprehend more matter than my tongue can utter, or the eye of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can diſcern; when I have ſeen all I can, I may ſay as did the blinde, <hi>Lord that I may receive my ſight.</hi>

            <p>This Lords prayer contains <hi>6.</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions like 6. ſhires, in which I ſpie a world of rarities; come let us range among them. As I enter into the frontiers of the firſt petition, theſe words I finde written to the honour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119880:35"/>of the great God, and our Father, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name:</hi> ſuch a land, ſuch a language, this little prayer is Gods little Iſle, the firſt words the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have on their tongue ends are theſe, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> Thus they are learnt at firſt to ſpeak and ſay, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name:</hi> a pretty ſpeech, as conciſe as the <hi>Laconians,</hi> as ſignificant as <hi>Caeſars</hi> three words. Here is <hi>magnum in parvo,</hi> much prayed for in few words; we pray to God, for God, ſinfull man, that Holineſſe it ſelf may be hallowed: a petition whoſe ſubject matter my methodobliges me to unfold, and to ſhew unto you what is meant by this ſaid, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralle.</note> Faith to beleeve the Kingdome to come.</p>
               <p>Patience to wait till it do come.</p>
               <p>Faith, whoſe eye is ever intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on a remote object.</p>
               <p>Patience, who only eyes, and none elſe but it owner.</p>
               <p>It is Faith which eſtates me in the heavenly Kingdome.</p>
               <p>It is Patience which procures my ſtay, till the Kingdome come.</p>
               <p>The firſt, Faith, makes my tack good</p>
               <p>This latter, Patience, the<note n="*" place="margin">This life.</note> interim, no annoyance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am reſolved to be earneſt with my God,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> to give me two ſuch gifts of grace, as both aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me of<note n="*" place="margin">kingdome of heaven.</note> that I want, and without the leaſt repining, overcomes mean man to wait the Lords leiſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith is that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder,<note place="margin">Faiths Character.</note> by which I aſcend up from off earth into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>It is Faith, intitles me to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in reverſion, though I have not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119880:63"/>a mole-hill in poſſeſſion. Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen, and as needfull as is Evidence to lay claim by, to an inheritance; as requiſite is faith for a ſuppliant to eſtate him in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven. He that with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart to God will put up this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, ſtands need of Faith to beleeve an heaven. Though my reaſon fails me to comprehend, my faith over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me to beleeve a Kingdome to come, my common ſenſe can reach no higher than to ſublunaries, it's my faith reaches to Celeſtials; my prayer is neither pithy nor patheticall, if my reaſon be nor interlared with faith.</p>
               <p>I prate, I pray not, if I ſall ſhort to beleeve an heaven. And here though I have leave to live in an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, want faith, and I ſhall never enjoy the Kingdome of Heaven: as my tongue muſt be guided by reaſon, ſo my heart led on by ſaith, or elſe in vain I ſay this petition: my faith muſt be founded on Gods Words, and his Word is the wafter tranſports faith to my ear, All ſaid is true, and for certain. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word preach'd: it is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119880:63"/>then hearing brings beleeving, and what I only hear of, I am enſur'd of belief, yea though I cannot ſet my eye on the Kingdome to come; the eye of faith makes conſpicuous what my bodily eye cannot diſcern. He that hath not faith to belleve what here prayed for, may pray all his life, yet miſſe what he prayes for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For my own part,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> while I pray with my tongue, I will beleeve with my heart, leſt my want of beleef bereave my prayer of a bleſſing.</hi>

It is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience perſwades us to take time and wait the Lords leiſure.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119880:64"/>feaver of preſent deſire. When I long for what I want, here is one overcomes me to wait till my want be ſupplyed: and where as by promiſe I have paſt me heaven, Patience adviſes to paſſe by the preſent expectance, in hopes of future performance. O thou qualifier of my deſire, who wils me not yet to look for, yet ſtill to hope for; in whoſe repute is neither time paſt nor preſent, but to come:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since thou canſt procure me time to ſtay,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> I am reſolved to wait, yea and poſſeſſe my ſoul with patience, till it be Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to give me the Kingdome.</hi>

This is <hi>filius ante diem,</hi> a baſe bred brat, brought out before due time; a haſty fellow, and too forward, mindes not, what is prayed for, muſt be ſtayed for: and that bad deſert muſt reſt content with after owning. This is he, is more forward than wiſe, and would have, what none here living have, Heaven in hand. How do we wrong our Fortune, when we will needs have it before our time. Though I deſire to be diſſolved, and be with Chriſt, yet will I wait till the Lord give and the Lord take. I will not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119880:65"/>unmannerly haſte God till he pleaſe, leſt I diſpleaſe God with my haft: we muſt firſt work, then have wages; yet ſome would have wages ere they work; yea be glorified, ere have ſuffered, as if Chriſt wore not a Crown of Thornes, before a Crown of Glory.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt, is the will of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the end.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:119880:67"/>
               <p> The ſecond, the will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the means leading to the end.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe hath relation to the glorified in heaven, the puniſhed in hell.</p>
               <p>The other to the Saints exerciſing gracious life, but never to ſinners li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a lewd life.</p>
               <p>To bring theſe home to the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, here we pray for Gods will to be done, that <hi>voluntus finis ſegregatim,</hi> it may ſtand with the ſecret will of God in his good time to glorifie thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non conjunctim,</hi> we call not of him to will the puniſhing of the reprobate in hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we pray to God his will may be done, that is, <hi>voluntas medii:</hi> the overture of the means of grace may be offered to us, and we lay hold of it; yet was it never Gods will: that the means, ſins which bring men to hell, that they ſhould actuate, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and blaſphemous were it to pray for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We pray then that Gods will may be done, that is, that it may be his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated will, that ſuch as he in ſecret
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119880:68"/>hath predeſtinated may be glorified, we pray not it may be Gods will, |any to be damned.</p>
               <p>We pray that the revealed means of grace, mediums to glory, may |be prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and profitable to all: but the means leading to Hell, which are ſins, God never wills; have we any cauſe then to pray him to will them?</p>
               <p>It is Gods will, and we pray for it, the means of grace, not the means to damn man. The firſt, God wils, not the latter. It is Gods will, and we pray for it, the glorifying man in heaven, not the puniſhing any in hell; both which God wils, only the firſt we pray for.</p>

And yet S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> perſwades me this is not the will we are will'd to pray may be accompliſhed: who ſaith, <hi>Non petimus ut Deus faciat quod vult, ſed ut nos facere poſſimus quod Deus vult:</hi> we do not pray in this petition, that God would bring to paſſe what he hath ſaid he would do: but here we pray for an ability for us to do as God wils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſpectu noſtrum,</hi> we pray, what is Gods will, we may have power and ſtrength to do it.</p>
               <p>Thy will O Lord, not my will, thy will only, not thine and mine, thy will let it be done, though I have been unwilling.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever God in his word wils, we muſt pray for ability to do it.</p>
               <p>And thruſt back, will the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, our will the corrivall, wilfull will would bear all the ſway, <hi>ſtet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione voluntas,</hi> like good ſubjects, let Gods will ſtand for a Law with us. That we pray for then, |and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119880:69"/>for good in this petition, is that Gods will may by us be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
               <p>The two then in the ſcales, are Gods will, and mans work, this is to be directed, by that preponed.</p>
               <p>As if, what man did, ſhould ſent of what God willed, as if what is Gods will may be our work.</p>

               <p>Secondly, I have learnt out a fit mate to match with my works, it is Gods will.</p>
               <p>Lord that we could ſpie theſe two and for ever together, our works then would have no ſuch adulterous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For my own part I am reſolved,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> the will of God ſhall be the ſquare of my work, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I undertake to do that work is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite againſt Gods good will and pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond word to be explained, is <hi>Earth,</hi> apparent while prayed, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth;</hi> ſuch may be the ſtones as be we, if God will, ſuch were
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119880:69"/>we, as the earth, at the beginning. There being ſuch conſanguinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that we tread on, and we that tread on it, may put us, and in doubt what is meant whileſt ſaid, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth.</hi> That in chief, is, that Gods written will may be done.</p>
               <p>In this Earth, <hi>pro loco,</hi> by us who are Earth, <hi>pro materia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we pray that all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants upon the earth, may apply their beſt endevours to do what God wils, were our practiſe ſutable to our prayers, our prayers proteſt we ſhould all the practiſ of Divine duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> while we put up this petition for all on Earth to do Gods will, I will call to minde what we all ſhould do, but bemoan, our tongues and lives are at oddes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But while we talk of <hi>Earth,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven muſt not be forgotten, which is the third word to be explained. And as by Earth, is meant men on earth; ſo by Heaven Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>And are Angels ſet to be mens ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers? pretty patterns, and could we take them out, our Maſter Chriſt would take it for well done.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:119880:70"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>O thou who made us in thy own likeneſſe,<note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat.</note> vouchſafe of thy wonted goodneſſe, that thy will may be done by us as by the Angles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is this all, other acceptations are at hand, would you be pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some underſtand by Earth Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, by Heaven the faithfull. The faithfull are the loweſt region of Gods Heavenly Kingdome. The Infidels are the upper regiment of the Devils earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dominion: and yet it is prayed for, that Gods will may be done by the one, as by the other; by the Infidels, as by the faithfull.</p>
               <p>O my God,<note place="margin">His Vote.</note> for all that all thy ſervants ſtudy to do thy will, yet will I beg that, that many may be made more by the converſion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, This fleſh, its originall is earth: the minde of man, a kin to an heavenly being, which hath cauſed ſome to harbour this conceit, that by Earth may be meant this fleſh of ours, or part unregenerate, by Heaven the minde or part regenerate; to which if we condeſcend, we muſt thus then read this petition, <hi>Thy will be done</hi> by the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119880:70"/>fleſh, as it is by the minde; by the fleſh which ſerves the Law of ſin, as by the minde which ſerves the law of God. Here are two parties in this Iſle of Man; the one holds of God in Heaven, the other of the Devill in Hell; and as Iſrael was divided betwixt <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> ſo this Iſle of man is made a divident: All is not for God, a corrupt part, takes part with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
               <p>This is it ſhall make me petition God,<note place="margin">His Vote.</note> that as that part of my minde, which is regenerate, ſo more of me may ſubſcribe to do Gods will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some by Earth may underſtand the Church militant, while by Heaven, Chriſt the head of the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and would have this the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this petition, Thy will be done by the Church in Earth, as it is done by thy Son in Heaven. Here we pray the Chuch on earth may take Chriſt in Heaven for a ſampler, and that we the members of this his Church would make his will our rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O God, we of thy Church will ſtudy to do thee ſervice, yet confeſſe,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> we have every day cauſe to beg we may come nigher the

               </p>
               <p>This diſtinguiſhing upon the three words, which ſeemed difficult to be underſtood, is, the porter hath brought the ſenſe of this petition, to the ſenſe of your hearing.</p>
               <p>The genuine meaning, is a collect of what ſaid, and now we have ſpeld, let us put together. <hi>Prime loco,</hi> here we beg of God he would inable us men on earth to do his will as do the Angels in heaven.</p>
               <p>Which is,

               </p>
               <p>Not by conſtraint, as ſome come to the Church, more for fear than love, not latchingly, as thoſe who came into the vineyard at the eleventh hour, meaning to have much for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little: when we go about Gods buſineſſe we muſt be merry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, and nimble footed, look blithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diſpatch ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>Theſe two they crown the action, and ſhewes the willingneſſe of the whole man to ſerve his Maker, ſuch a ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119880:71"/>though he cannot lay claim to ought by his own merit, yet may preſume of Gods mercy, whereas a grumbling ſervant, a delatory delayer, when as he thinks he hath done Gods work, may be payed in the Devils coyn. As what we| muſt do, muſt be what God wils, ſo all we do, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht, Angel-like, with alacrity, with celerity, this is the choice ſenſe of this petition. And yet here is involved a boon for Infidels to do Gods will as do the faithfull, |for this fleſh of ours to inlaw it ſelf to the Lord as doth the minde regenerate.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that this Church of Gods up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth may conforme it ſelf to the will of God as did the Head Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And now what we have ſaid,<note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat.</note> that it may be, and really performed, Dear Father, grant us thy children this one boon, that thy will may be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.</p>

               <p>A Divine Contemplation upon the Third Petition.</p>

                  <hi>Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I ſee what I ſhould do, but I Lord
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119880:81"/>how I fail in the performance. Thou O God haſt ſet me a pattern, but I come as far ſhort of the ſampler, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are diſtant from the Earth; I can ſoon learn to know what I ſhould do all my life is too little to learn to doe what I know. O God my God, though thou haſt given mee an underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heart, yet I finde in me my fleſh a perverſe will, even one who is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully unwilling to do thy will in Earth as it is in Heaven: What haſt thou left undone to teach me to do thy will. The Law of Nature, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Goſpell of Chriſt Jeſus: they ſpell and put together thy good will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt given me theſe to teach me, Angels to guide me, and all to lead me to know and do thy will in Earth as it is in Heaven. If |I would plead ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, thy unwritten Law in my heart condemns, thy written Word, the Law and Goſpell bear witneſſe againſt me. Nor is this all, but thoſe my ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers, thy Angels, ſhall one day cry to thee, to take vengeance on me. O how ought my heart to relent, when in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret I think upon it; what pains thou
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119880:81"/>haſt taken, and yet how unprofitable a ſcholar I have been in thy ſchoole. Thoſe to whom thou giveſt much, of them much is expected: I have received a large portion of inſtruction, but O the leſſon of obedience is not yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out. Dear Father, I confeſſe my wickedneſſe in thy preſence; I pray thee have merey upon me, have mercy upon me, and after the multitude of thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mercies in Chriſt Jeſus, forgive me all my ſins and treſpaſſes.</p>
               <p>O the thought what's to be done, and how it's to be done, aſſures me I am<note n="*" place="margin">he means without mercy.</note> undone.</p>
               <p>This is thy Will, and theſe are my Works; Was ever light and darkneſſe, truth and falſhood more oppoſite the one to the other? Had I but half an eye, I might ſee, what will be my end without amendment.</p>
               <p>O thou who delighteſt not in the death of a ſinner, heal the diſeaſe in my ſoul, my ſoul is ſick to death, yet Lord, ſay the word, and thy ſervant ſhall be healed: O thou Phyſitian of ſouls, give me a potion of faith, faith to beleeve, and the cure is wrought. It cannot be my acting, but any belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119880:82"/>how Chriſt hath exactly acted my part, muſt make my weak works well, and gain them my Gods good liking.</p>
               <p>Let my belief in thee beget a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in me, to do thy will; Then my God for Chriſt his ſake will accept of my will for the deed. Tack up then my Soul, and look up to that brazen Serpent Chriſt. In him, and by him, thou haſt done the deed: yet when all is done, ſay it is no morel, but Chriſt who dwelleth in me. But if out of Chriſt, thou art out of hopes, to do Gods will in Earth as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</p>
               <p>The naturall man is the impotent man, and can neither the <hi>Quid</hi> nor <hi>Quale:</hi> It's no marvell, for ſaith S. <hi>Paul, He perceives not the things of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O my ſoul, while thou art in the ſtate of corrupted nature, thou art in an hell of diſobedience. Let the noiſe of the Law awake thee, the voice of the Goſpell allure thee, to march out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> out of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtate and condition. Soul, why ſtandeſt thou gazing? while in Nature nought can be done, neither what God wils, nor as he wils.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:119880:82"/>
               <p> O thou God of all Spirits, create in me a new heart; take me out of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> engraffe me in the new: make me a branch of that Vine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. and I ſhall bring forth cluſters of ⋆ grapes. Of my ſelf I have no power to bring forth: only in Chriſt I live and move in an Angelicall ſampler of obedience. I muſt go out of my ſelf, ere I can get into the footſteps of they Angels. Let the Archangel of the Covenant enable my feeble ſoul, to do thy will in Earth as it is in Heaven.</p>

               <p>Here I finde one only word needs explaining, Bread, we want of our wils, if we have not Bread every day in our mouthes: our head-pieces muſt now give it harbour, that as the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bread pleaſes the palat, ſo the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,<note place="margin">A Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, what we pray for.</note> I mean its meaning, may ſatisfie our underſtanding, here we pray for bread, that God would give us bread: this day bread, daily bread, our daily bread; for ſubſtance, bread; for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, this day bread; for condition, ſuch as we uſe daily; for appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our daily bread:<note place="margin">A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</note> not ſell, but give; not one, but us; not us here, but

A paradox, our need is daily, our daily need, daily bread: the daily bread we need, is this day our daily bread; this is it we beggers beg of our good Rabboni, <hi>give us this day our daily bread:</hi> this laſt word, <hi>bread,</hi> is the firſt word I will fall in hand with, I hope all your ſtomachs in like ſort ſtand to it.</p>
               <p>There are three ſorts of Bread as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure</hi> well obſerves,

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By Corporall Bread fimply under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I mean bodily Bread made to feed on, and ſuſtain life with, and thun the word is uſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.33. where it is ſaid by Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>Whence ſhould we have ſo much bread in the wilderneſſe, as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119880:84"/>to fill ſo great a multitude?</hi> and this I call feeding Bread.</p>
               <p>The mixt corporall Bread, made as it were of Miſcellan; by it I mean Bread made up of a proper and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, not only ſuch bread as we eat, but all things neceſtary for this life, and thus Bread is taken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.25. where ſaid, <hi>I will bleſſe thy Bread. Prov.</hi> 20.13. <hi>I will ſatisfie thee with Bread:</hi> by it is meant, God will give a ſupply of all earthly neceſſaries for this life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Sacramental<note n="*" place="margin">Spiritual and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.</note> bread; that this is ſo, turn to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> And this I call ſignifying Bread, or Bread ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a third bread, bread Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; to prove this, turn to <hi>Joh. 6.</hi> where ſaid, <hi>Ego ſum panis vivus,</hi> I am the living bread: this bread is Chriſt. A piece of this bread, who ſo taſtes of, ſhall never hunger, and this I call the laſty Bread.</p>
               <p>Now here we pray for corporall Bread, bodily ſuſtenance, ſacramentall Bread, to have ſtill a taſte of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated ſhive which ſhewes out Chriſts death.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:119880:84"/>
               <p> Here we pray for that eternal Bread, for Chriſt, that God would give us Chriſt, intereſting us in him all, his Birth, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion. And thus while we ſay this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<list>
                     <item>1. We pray for Bread to nouriſh our bodies.</item>
                     <item>2. The Sacrament to ſtrengthen our feeble faith.</item>
                     <item>3. For Chriſt to feed our ſouls to life everlaſting.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe are the three ſorts of Bread ſhadowed out by the three loaves in the Goſpell: the firſt loaf whereof can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice humane life: the ſecond loaf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſpiritual life: the third loaf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life eternal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Lord ever give us of this Bread,<note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat.</note> that ſo Lord here we may live, live well, and live with thee, hold out the life of nature,<note place="margin">The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</note> live the life of grace, and attain to the life of glory.a</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe three ſorts of Bread are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, yet all, as I ſuppoſe, are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, not the Sacramentall Bread, for that was askt in the ſecond petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, As it is conjectured by ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> Bread ith' Church keeping, by which I
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119880:85"/>mean, not Shewbread, provided for Prieſts, but Communion-bread equally by us Miniſters diſtributed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers; nor yet is the Bread eternall here meant, for here we pray but for a daies Bread; that laſts for ever, this ends with ſupper.</p>
               <p>The Bread then primarily here meant is corporall Bread, not reſtrained lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to bodily Bread only as meat for, the belly, this is not all we here pray for; but the Bread here meant is corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Bread, meant at large figuratively. And the petition involves a Boon, that God would beſtow on us all things neceſſary for this life.</p>
               <p>And ſo I come to give you the ſenſe and meaning of this fourth petition, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, Good father of us all, be pleaſed to beſtow on us all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for this life: yea whatſoever thou ſeeſt in thy wiſdome behoovefull for us.</p>
               <p>Lo an immenſe Boon begged in one line, all we want, and in word, a ſhort expreſſion, but a large, look for, not much ſaid, yet much craved, apparent whileſt only bread askt, and in asking it, all neceffaries.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:119880:85"/>
               <p> But how comes ſo much meant, when ſo little ſaid? here is only Bread askt, can it involve all things elſe?</p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer, this is named in ſtead of all, <hi>propter excellentiam, quod inſtar omnium,</hi> want it, we had as good want all, no comfort can be taken, and take this away; neither in apparell, pleaſure, profit, diet, or ought, indeed it is one gives a reliſh to all earthly bliſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We name Bread for all, <hi>propter capacitatem,</hi> give us food to live by, and while life is preſerved, threr is a ſtep on, to what not, to the attaining of every good and perfect gift of God, Temporary, as health, wealth, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Thou ſayeſt the wicked hath more than thou that ſerveſt and feareſt the Lord: alas, when one hath all his eſtate laid on an heap, it makes a fair ſhew, but that in ſhew is all.

               <p>This Vice of all other, is the devils darling, Gods accurſt, and mans miſchief maker; that <hi>Abſalom</hi> that ſteals away the hearts of the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and allures us from our allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our Lord God: This is that one can do more with the wag of his finger,<note place="margin">Hiſt.</note> than <hi>Pompey</hi> with the ſtamp of his foot; and hath, and no few, at as much command as the Centurion his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; where this <hi>malus habitus</hi> inhabits, men are made very ſlaves; whom this vice bids goe, he goes; come, he comes; do this, he doth it.</p>

O! cuſtome in ſin makes no conſcience of ſin; and the ofter the ſin's commited, the ſeldomer the ſinner findes fault with it; a daily treſpaſſer is a ſtiffe out-facer; and what is every day done, the doer of it thinks the leſſe ſhame of, though it deſerve more to be reproved, yet it leſſe grieves, and by much.

               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe three laſt petitions hath been put up for neceſſaries we want.</p>
               <p>The ſecond to forgive what we owe.</p>
               <p>And now this third, for our defence from harm catching by temptation; joyntly that I am led on to light on from this <hi>us,</hi> as it caſts a glance over theſe three laſt petitions, is this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite conſideration, To meditate.</p>
               <p>How miſerable is man that hath not, <hi>muſt have Remit,</hi> and without a writ of protection is ſtill undone. It is we
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119880:128"/>are poor, have nought to pay, yet bold to crave the Kings protection: what can he think walks with a procetion? but how gracious his King, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall the ſpend-thriſt, and what woe would follow him, but for mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am reſolved,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> whenſoever I come to this latter part, of my</hi> Pacer noſter, <hi>to period it with an admication of Gods protection</hi> of him,<note place="margin">The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</note> hath nought, <hi>is in dept, and daily-in danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſee for what we put up this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, as well can witneſſe the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; it is put up, and to this end, for avoiding of dammage by Tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not for avoiding the field, but foil; not for avoiding the fight, but defeat; not for avoiding the battle, but ominous overthrow in the battle; we pray not againſt our life being a warfare; no, we muſt be right <hi>Spartans,</hi> born with Launces, fight the good fight, with beaſts, as <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> with great overgrown Gyants, as <hi>David</hi> did, with ſpirituall wickedneſſes: theſe are our enemies. In a word, the combat muſt be continued againſt theſe three, the Heroglyphicks of the world, the fleſh, and the Devill.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:119880:128"/>
               <p> We pray not then againſt the war, but being wounded in the war. There will be war while life, and muſt be prayer for preſervation in the war, from wounding. In war, to prayer,<note place="margin">Note.</note> Heart muſt play its part as well as hand. In this life militant, I expect an onſet, and will pray for a prevail: I matter not whom I meet, ſo God inable me, to lift up to him my heart, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did his hand.</p>
               <p>My prayer put up in this ſpirituall warfare, makes the oddes on my ſide, two to once, my heart and tongue give the onſet on him that ſets upon me, I mean Temptation, when I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt to wage warre with ſpirituall wickedneſſes; it's prayer revives my ſtrength: I learnt this divine ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to re-inforce my force afreſh of <hi>Samſon,</hi> who when half ſtarved, blinde of both eyes, a poor priſoner, yet by prayer, received power to be revenged of his and Gods enemies, the Lords of the Philiſtims.<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all.</note> How great ſoever be the man of ſin, come out to |upbraid Gods little champion, the leaſt of If<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, a poor Saint ſhall have ſtrength enough to bring to his knees the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt

I ſhall give the man of ſin, the fall and foil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But take an obſervation more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the text, we put up this petition againſt the Lead on into temptation,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that is harm hapning by it. Lo a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wound we muſt have life, but limbs; as to eſcape death, ſo damage; as a mortall wound, ſo a green wound, which may be healed.</p>
               <p>This care had <hi>David,</hi> apparent by that he ſaid, <hi>Lord I will take. heed unto my waies.</hi> The Evangeliſt warned the Jewes to have a care of this, when ſaid to them, <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, here's proviſion taken, againſt an open aſſault and a ſmall skirmiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O that this care were had over our bodies and ſould, then we might play at foiles, and not receive ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull vinnies.<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Now ſee what it is we pray for, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not divide Deliverance from Evill, ſince Evill without Deliverance delivers us up to death: Let us tye theſe two, a good and a bad together; and though the wolves guts being placed nigh the ſheeps tharmes fret them all to pirces, yet it's my hopes this Innocent ſhal have the better of that Malefactor: and that the nigher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance makes his approach, the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denner downfall will betide Evill. Let us team then theſe two together, as <hi>Samſon</hi> did his foxes to burn up the land of the Philiſtims. But to ſave from ſpoil, the<note n="*" place="margin">Soul:</note> land of iſrael:

                     <item>1. I mean, let us treat upon Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Evill, <hi>conjunctim,</hi> our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Evill.</item>
                     <item>2. Then upon Evill all alone.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, theſe two, Devill and ſin, are comprehended under this one only word, Evill, from which we pray for Deliverance, to deliver us from Evill, and what to deliver, and us, and from theſe thus named.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:119880:130"/>
               <p> This ſewes us,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the Devill and ſin are our worſt of enemies; that abroad, this at home; that without doors, this within doors; that the prince of the aire, this which we heir from <hi>Adam,</hi> and earths in us, and dwels in us, in our bodies, in our ſouls. Theſe two ſeek the deſtruction of our ſouls and bodies. Whoſo hears the cry of the Crocodile, immediately he is a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. O fear not him can kill the body, but theſe can kill both body and ſoul. Let me count of theſe for foes, who are of force to be my undoing, the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all me and for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what worſe enemies than theſe, which are alwaies at oddes with us. Earthly enemies, are not ever in action, take ſometimes truce with us, the truth is, theſe two never take truce, no not a minute, a moment. Devill his daily journey is to compaſſe the earth, and all to make us helliſh proſelytes. Sin like the Sun, is in continuall motion, like the fountain ever bubling. Hence ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Why do thoughts ariſe?</hi> and you ſhall ſee what ariſe and turn to. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.21.</p>
               <p>Streams of waters of <hi>Mara,</hi> and amin,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119880:130"/>and ſo many, able to drown the Iſrael of God, as the Red ſea all the hoſt of the Egyptians.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the Devill and ſin ſeek to deſtroy, <hi>&amp; unum &amp; unitatem,</hi> not only this or that perſon, but the ſpecies,<note place="margin">Hiſt.</note> the whole kinde and poſterity of <hi>Adam. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> wiſht all <hi>Rome</hi> had but one head, that ſo with one blow he might be their utter overthrow; what he wiſht theſe have wrought, even all our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes. The <hi>Mirandillian</hi> Butchery, the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Mattens, the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Evenſong, fall all far ſhort of that theſe two have complotted, acted, againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and all us his off-ſpring. And honce iſſues out my ill conceit againſt the Devill and ſin.</p>
               <p>Yea their hate to our kinde,<note place="margin">The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</note> their continuall hate, which ſtretches out its limits beyond this life to deprive us of a life everlaſtign: this foul fact of theſe two, hath made me reſolve upon it, to repair to thoſe three, to the trine Unity or Trinity in unity, &amp; all to put up to them this petition, <hi>Lord lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now go take notice from what we deſire deliverance, it is from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119880:131"/>Evill. By which word, Evill, you have heard is meant the Devill and Sin: this is their ſtyle, nones elſe.</p>
               <p>That I note is,<note place="margin">Note.</note> nought is more evill than the Devill and Sin.</p>

               <p>The Caſes of Conſeience now next come in, and they be three.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:119880:131"/>
               <p> The firſt whereof is this,<note place="margin">I. Caſe</note> after what manner, doth Luſt and Concupiſcence temps us to fin, or intice or draw us on from ſerving God, to become the ſervants of ſin.</p>
               <p>This is the hardeſt thing in the world to diſcover, and therefore much pains muſt be taken to compleat an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſatisfactory. Such a ſerious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as this is, ſlighting of it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly, and the Orator ſhould be as ill thought of,<note place="margin">Hiſt</note> as <hi>Alexander</hi> thought of <hi>Cherillus,</hi> who gave him money to hold his peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is and for this cauſe that I am reſolved firſt to demonſtrate, how luſt effects this feat by a ſimile.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To make the point more perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, I purpoſe, God willing, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe luſts ſick daies march through the heart of man, and all to captivate poor foul and take the Man priſoner, and lead him into that ſtrong hold call'd Temptation.</p>
               <p>Firſt this may be made appear by a Simile drawn from flowers, how luſt or concupiſcence entices or draws man on to ſin.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:119880:132"/>
               <p> You know there paſſes from flowers a ſubtle vapour, which the ſenſe of ſmelling drawes in, and which drawes away the ſenſe with delight after it. So luſt which ſprung up in the Garden of Eden after <hi>Eve</hi> had finned, from it, as from a flower, paſſes a ſubtle vapour of evill thoughts.</p>
               <p>And as the ſent of the flower, goes on by the organ of ſmell into the brain; ſo a ſent of luſts, even evill thoughts, are carryed by that organ the common ſenſe into the heart.</p>
               <p>And as the delightfull ſmell makes us in love with the ſubtle vapour: ſo the pleaſures of luſts make us affect the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of evill, which come from luſt. Nor are thoſe evill vapours a few, but full many, apparent by thoſe already quoted words of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. <hi>Why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts?</hi> Theſe are infectious vapours and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the ſoul than fenny miſts to the body, if not ſcattered and blown a way by Gods Spirit: they poyſon ſoul, and caſt underſtanding, will, and memory, the ſouls publick Notary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Feaver ſits.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Luſt the lewd, imitates God the good; God, ſix daies wrought, to perfect the creation.</p>
               <p>Luſt takes as many daies pains to deface the map Man, the modell of all Gods great work, that great work of creation.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:119880:133"/>

                  <hi>Nota faciendi voti,</hi> a note of a vow.

               <p>This is to heap ſin upon ſin, while we vow we will ſerve God, and ſerve the Devill. Thou hadſt better never promiſe, then never performe, and ſay nought than ſay Amen: and not minde to what that one word hath bound thee.</p>
               <p>Amen is ſoon ſaid, but bindes to much.

               <p>Amen then, is as much as all ſaid, I aſſent to: in the Church ſervice faid by the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>And let me tell you what I think, it is this.</p>
               <p>How it is a laudable faſhion and commendable cuſtome in our congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, That when we have ſaid Church Service, being agrreeable with holy Bible, for the people to cry Amen at end.</p>
               <p>Beleeve me, as it is the Clerks office, ſo your duties to cry Amen, your Amen is the man, conjoynes Prieſts and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts together: nay know't, he that hath not a mouth to cry Amen, I dare ſay wants an heart to call on God. It is a ſmall requeſt, if we ſay ſervice, for you to ſay Amen; it is a great benefit for a little disburſement, when one only word intereſts you in all the prayers we have made.</p>
               <p>My deſire is, when I ſay ſervice, to hear the whole Congregation ſay, Amen:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Avſtin.</note> 
                  <hi>Audiri veluti Coeleſte tonitru popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum reboantem Amen:</hi> I deſire to hear the people founding Amen as thunder

O! it ſheweth that the prayer ſayed by the Miniſter, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people anſwer, Amen, <hi>omnium eſſe communem,</hi> to be common to all; thou loſeſt thy part by leaving out Amen: and know't, he that will not lend God his tongue to ſay Amen, it's not probable God will be ſo free hearted to him, as to grant him that of which there is not the leaſt teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he deſired it.</p>
               <p>To conclude, he muſt play the Clerk, that would profit by what uttered by the Prieſt. Here is an happy way found out for the good of our ignorant, yet know't to your comfort, by ſaying, though but in ſome ſort underſtanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Amen. The Preachers ſervice is made yours, &amp; you may come to gain as much by ſaying, Amen, as he that ſaith all the words at large in the <hi>Common-prayer-book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An inducement ſufficient to cauſe all to ſay Amen. We have our task ſet out to read Service, this is yours, to ſay A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Church-ſervice is half leſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, while you neglect to ſay, Amen; and the far greater part, for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have unacted their part:<note n="*" place="margin">Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> We put in our replication, while we ſay

               <p>
                  <hi>Now Lord grant that while we ſpeak to thee for us our ſelves, and for the people:<note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat.</note> the people may joyne with us, and that their, Amen, to our prayers may teſtifie their good and godly meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I finde this Amen ſet at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> latter end of our Lords Prayer,<note place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, Since the Text is ſo ſhort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> give me leave to extract an heavenly fancy from the letters in this laſt word of our Lords Prayer. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

               <p>Fiſtly,<note place="margin">The firſt ſenſe of my <hi>pater noſter</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> He end all with two divine Meditations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let me give you the three ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:119880:162"/>of my <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> Amen: and firſt of the firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This <hi>pater noſter,</hi> Amen, may here be taken <hi>pro juris jurandi nota,</hi> for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony upon oath: thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. it is as much as Verily, and it is Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed oft, by

                     <item>Truly, or</item>
                     <item>Verily.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Yet when thus Engliſhed, <hi>incipit non deſinit,</hi> commonly it begins ends not the ſentence.</p>
               <p>Yet in this place, <hi>dum deſinit affirmat aſſeveratione,</hi> while we end with this word, we proteſt all ſaid is our minde.</p>
               <p>And now ſee when you have made an end of praying, this word, Amen, vowes you take your oath on it; that your prayer is your very hearts deſire.</p>
               <p>Amen, that is, Lord what I have prayed for, I take an holy on't, I defire it.<note place="margin">The Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> A parlous proteſtation, and gives all thoſe a vehement knock over ſhins, who ſay one thing and mean another: With the Hawk in windy words towring into the air, when their aim and end is on the earth.</p>
               <p>The word being now underſtood, may make thoſe change their counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:119880:162"/>who beg of God deliverance from the deceits of the ſleſh, <note n="*" place="margin">Amen.</note>here they ſoar up, and yet mean when prayers are done, to have familiarity with the ſleſh, her affections and luſts, here they fall flat down. Theſe are perjured perſons <hi>coram Deo,</hi> Amen is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>And now me thinks this ſhould ſhame ſundry of us; that as it is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by this<note n="*" place="margin">Amen.</note> examined, have ſworn theſe religious purpoſes are our minde, and yet minde to do nought leſſe. O it is a fearfull thing to diſſemble with God Almighty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now what good we ſay with our tongues,<note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat.</note> Lord give us grace to imbrace in our hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> Amen, may ſignifie <hi>ipſam veritatem,</hi> the very truth. The faithfull and true witneſſe, and thus Amen is taken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14. where ſaid unto the Church of the <hi>Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, write theſe things ſaith the Amen,</hi> that is, <hi>the faithfull and true witneſſe:</hi> there as it is interpreted by common conſent, Amen ſignifies Chriſt: And ſo may do here, and then ſee you not to Chriſts hand-writing he ſets his name, for Amen is as much as Chriſt: and then
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:119880:163"/>thus this prayer is perioded with this word, this being its laſt word, Chriſt.</p>
               <p>How doth this interpretation lead one by the hand,<note place="margin">Three Inferences.</note> and lets me ſee,
<list>
                     <item>1. How without Chriſt, firſt and laſt in my heart, nought's to be had,</item>
                     <item>2. Without coming in his name, nought's to be gotten.</item>
                     <item>3. Without my Saviour Chriſt, my prayer hath loſt its favour.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Let me not leave off to meditate on it, and oft, how Chriſt is the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our prayers; and certainly ſo he is—O ſacred ſound which ſweetens all our prayers, and makes them all well pleaſing to God Almighty!</p>
               <p>The body of <hi>Moſes</hi> interpoſed, ſtopt the plague: The name, Jeſus, ſeals the bliſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now bleſſed be this ever bleſſed Lord and 0664 2 Saviour of all our ſouls,<note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat.</note> Chriſt Jeſus, and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am reſolved never to leave out in my prayer,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> no not this laſt word, Amen, ſince this Amen is as much as Chriſt, which one ſound if from the heart uttered, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, is able to procure Gods bleſſe on ail my prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this <hi>pater noſter</hi> Amen, may
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119880:163"/>be taken <hi>pro ſigno ſubſcriptionis,</hi> for a token or mark ſet to, to aſſure our ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to what foreſpoken: Thus it is taken <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. and thus it may be here meant; here, Amen, is as much as if the ſuppliant ſhould ſay, Lord I do ſubſcribe in heart to what my tongue hath uttered.</p>
               <p>That I note is this, That Amen,<note place="margin">Note.</note> doth acknowledge all foreſaid to be the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants true meaning: Amen is Avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, avouches all ſaid for truth and right when he comes in, I mean, Amen; he juſtifies all before, he bends us to yeeld to all ſaid, and brings us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe freely we like of all we have heard,<note place="margin">Three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</note> uttered or read, An obſervation I may make a Tripartite uſe of. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there be ſuch worth in ſaying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Amen, ſay it as oft as occaſion cals on thee.</p>
               <p>Let not this godly prayer be read in thy ear, but have provided for it an <hi>Amen;</hi> a word well becomes our mouthes, every one is for the new cut, but come keep in this old faſhion, of ſaying Amen, as meſſenger newly alight, and the laſt at that gate-houſe, your lips, which witneſſes what you have
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119880:164"/>ſubſcribed to, you are perſwaded is the very truth, and that truly you deſire it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This interpretation may ſerve to teach you, and you be not too old to learn, to minde what read, before you ſet ſeal, Amen, to it; to minde what ſaid, ere you ſay Amen: I had as live hear a Wood-pecker whiſtle, and Owle ſhriek, a Parret prate, as hear a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioner ſay Amen, that mindes not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not prayer went before; ſuch fellowes as theſe were fit to make hackney witneſſes of, for whereas others would ſwear, but what they know is truth, theſe will witneſſe all is true, though they never minded what ſaid.</p>
               <p>But that with a good conſcience, you may cry Amen, minde what ſaid, it is thy part, for thou art to paſſe thy cenſure on it: can the Jury paſſe a juſt verdict, mindes not pleadings? im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>The ſimile ſuits with thee, and warnes thee to note all thy<note n="*" place="margin">Petitions pend or ſpoke.</note> paper-books, that thou maiſt be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an Amen, that is a poſitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence all is true.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 3. This interpretation refels the folly of our ignorant Papiſts, who
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:119880:164"/>when the Seminary ſaith the prayer in Latine, cry Amen, which ſhould not be denounc't, but of what underſtood; he may as well curſe them, as bleſſe them, for ought they know, and yet they cry Amen. A folly to approve for good they know not what, a blinde devotion when is out the eye, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, a cuſtome inexcuſable, that the ignorant people ſhould cry Amen to Service read in Latine. Surely they have aſſured confidence in their Prieſts: and I aſſure you their Prieſts had need to have more honeſty, than their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers have wit. But let them be never ſo honeſt, I ſee no reaſon for it, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples faith ſhould be pinn'd on the ſleeves of their Prieſts good meaning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would have all my people to know what I ſay, and to ſay, Amen, but not till they fully underſtand what ſaid.</p>
               <p>A duty the more I urge men to—
<list>
                     <item>1. For it begets devotion.</item>
                     <item>2. Makes us all of one minde.</item>
                     <item>3. Intereſts each of you, in the hopes of getting ſomething by prayer.</item>
                  </list>

               <p>The third part of my method moves me to give you the compleat chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of this one Amen,<note place="margin">Amens Character</note> I mean, its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in decurt ſhort ſignificant ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. Amen then, as you have heard, is an Hebrew by Nation, a Laconian by Language, and a traveller by nature; hath talkt with ſundry of ſundry na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and when they have ſaid all they can, gives them it all over in a word.</p>
               <p>This is hath marcht through all the provinces in the Chriſtian world, yet in the rear, never in the front. The Officer at armes who drawes up the broad Body into a little circle. The ſon of <hi>Mars</hi> makes an end of all; he is plac't the loweſt, yet is of greateſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:119880:167"/>for comprehends <hi>quic quid in buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam venit,</hi> the laſt yet the firſt while from the firſt to the laſt; all hangs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency upon this one, Amen. This is the pacifier of the people, which makes them of one minde: the little map deciphers out their unanimous univerſall agreement, the proſective glaſſe in which I ſee a fort gone farre before.</p>
               <p>The notary bears in minde every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition put up. Lo the repeater over of our prayers, which bindes all us to bear in minde all ſaid.</p>
               <p>This Amen is a <hi>memento</hi> for man, and a <hi>teſtis</hi> to God: our remembrance of what ſpoke, and the witneſſe betwixt God and us, we meant as we ſpoke: this is he ſaies little, yet ſaies much, while gives us <hi>magnum in parvo,</hi> much, in a little, a word of weight, which if pondered, weighs as heavie as the whole prayer. Behold the nut is nought but kernell: the fountain is ſea-full, and the ſhip is full fraught: this is it, fils and full the magazine, mans underſtanding, and hath to lay up a ſomewhat leſt in the out-room, memory. Will muſt not be a wanting, leſt there be a want when
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:119880:167"/>ſearch is made for what came aboard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will board the booty in this bottome,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry.</note> and deſite my God to give me underſtanding to conceive, and memory to bear in minde, all lies hid in this howle, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But come, what is it lies here hid? <hi>Sub tegmine Deus, ſub tegmine Chriſtus:</hi> as much Amen ſignifies, God Chriſt, Chriſt God: himſelf ſaies, <hi>I am the Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you end with God and Chriſt, have nought to do with the Devill; have you Chriſt in your mouthes? keep then Satan out of your hearts. Thou never with a good heart ſayeſt this prayer, but this laſt word ſhuts door upon the Devill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Principium a Jove, finis Jeſu,</hi> thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneſt with the Father, endeſt with the Son. Without doubt the Spirit is thy guide, and teaches thee to pray, teaches thee thus to pray, teachers thee<note n="*" place="margin">Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> this to ſay: let me tell thee, to have God in thy mouth, the Son on thy tongue end, makes probable proof, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is in thy heart. So on the other ſide to ſlight ſuch a prayer, which begins with our Father, ends with the Son, maketh it more than
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:119880:168"/>probable, the Spirit of the Lord is departed from that ſuppliant: take it for a maxime in Divinity, he that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſes to ſay Chriſts Prayer, is not inſpired with chriſts Spirit.</p>
               <p>Let me tell you, I can ſee no other cauſe why any ſhould lay aſide, our Lords Prayer, unleſſe unwilling to uſe the name, God the Father at the firſt, and God the Son at the end, in their Roſary. The Jewes were ſo fear'd to take Gods Name in vain, that they uſed another word in ſtead: it may be, we have ſuch a piour people, who fear to ſin, if they ſhould do what Chriſt bids them doe, Say the Lords Prayer: yet ſince Amen is in ſtead of Chriſt, there is no excuſe, neither ever took I thoſe men to be ſqueaſie ſtomach, who can ſtrain at a gnat and ſwallow a Camel; who make ſcruple to ſay Chriſts prayer, yet ſtick not to rob Chriſts Church: in one work, who deſtroyed her Diſcipline, defaced her Doctrine, unhallowed her ſacred Sacraments: and doe to many of Gods Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, as <hi>Hanun</hi> did with <hi>Davids,</hi> cut off their garments to the hams.</p>
               <p>Beleeve me, thoſe who have ſuch
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:119880:168"/>ſtrong ſtomachs to the maintenance of the Miniſtry, I never knew bear any good will to the Doctrine of the Church: They will cry Amen ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the one then the other. I will leave them, and pray for them, the Lord awake them out of that ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſin, <hi>Sacriledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I paſſe on to the fourth part of my method, which deſires, ſince the ſubject is ſhort, you would give me leave to extract an heavenly fancy from the letters in this laſt word of our Lords Prayer. I know ſome will carp at it; but for my own part, I am reſolved never to write without a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by ſome. But know you it, the letters in this one word, involve a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, while all the letters in, Amen, — make up <hi>mane</hi>—

               <p>This divine fancy hath brought out two twins, I mean two heavenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations: and this is the fiſt part of my method, and the perfecter of my promiſe.</p>
               <p>But I will extract them, and more properly from this very laſt, word of our Lords Prayer, which word being, Amen, I look not at, as taken <hi>adverbia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> for them commonly it begins the verſe, this ends the prayer: yet when Amen is ſo uſed, it ſignifies <hi>Verily, very.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But let me look at this Amen, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>nominaltter,</hi> for a noon, for him who is the truth, for Chriſt,</p>
               <p>From this expoſition wich is the moſt lofty, and warranted out of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> I will extract two Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">Rev. 3.14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, What doth Amen ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie? Chriſt, Chriſt who is α and ohgr;, the firſt, and the laſt, from all eternity, and to laſt everſtingly: and with this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſound, ſhut I up my prayer: that this is thus, this Amen is my witneſſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt meditation riſes from hence is this: Since we end our prayer with him was from the beginning, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Meditate how this puts us in mind to have Timely thoughts: <hi>mane,</hi> early to fall to prayers.

               <p>Meditate upon't how you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin too ſoon to ſerve God: for <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> the young, and <hi>Joſias</hi> at ten are tendring their ſervice. So ſoon as ſpring, graſſe growes. This time of grace is ſpring-time, let's ſee prayers put up as thickly quickly as graſſe growes, elſe the work of nature will overgrow this gift of grace, and there be found more barrenneſſe in the womb of thy heart, than in the heart of the Earth.</p>

               </p>
               <p>You ſee now what you ſhould doe, firſt fall to prayers, ere you open ſhops or you make a bargain, this ſhould be firſt done, pray to God: let me gripe you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What ſay you now to thoſe who with <hi>Martha</hi> are trouble about many things, yet leave undone this <hi>unum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarium,</hi> praying, it may be they think to wax wealthier by working than talking; it holds in temporals, not in ſpirituals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What ſay you now to thoſe muſt be roaring of their peals of Ordnance on the Lords days, when all the Bels in the Church have rung them a peal to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:119880:171"/>come to prayers, It may be they think there's more to be got by the ſword than the Word; as wiſe as he is he's deceiv'd thinks ſo. Religion is not ſo far gone down dike, ſo much foot-hold in our Iſland, Atheiſme I hope ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What ſay you now to thoſe whom an early chapman makes them put off God to another time. It may be they think more to be got by trucking and lying, then beggin: but remember, the begger is in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; but as for all liars, their portion is damnation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What ſay you now to thoſe, who all their lives have made ſhew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but that's all; are not the men, men take them for. The Hieroglyphick of theſe outſide Saints, is a Gallant in a Buſſe-coat, that never fought.</p>
               <p>Theſe look like Saints militant, yet never fought with Beaſts at <hi>Epheſus—</hi> They gild over their ſpirituall cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize with divine formalities. Theſe are they accuſe us for being overmuch ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious; and yet themſelves have no more but the form of godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not of all, yet of the moſt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:119880:171"/>of all; almoſt all, of that Sect, ſociety think themſelves ſomething when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They are taxt for't by St. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let me tell theſe conceited pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, I ſay not proficients in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: but ſuch as only profeſſe they are proficients in grace and godlineſſe, yet go as flowly on to Heaven, as that Beaſt of which it is reported, he goes but a yard betwixt ſun and ſun.</p>
               <p>This is it I am to tell you, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never makes a man have too good a conceit of himſelf: true zeal is no braggadochio, he that thinks there is none bettern, there is none worſe: a windy profeſſor is commonly a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Goſpeller.</p>
               <p>Be thou the proud Phariſee, Ile be the poor Publican: and while thou vaunteſt what thou canſt do, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be ſorry I can do no better.</p>
               <p>But come, a word or two with thee who hath the forme of godlineſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt the poor of it; who talkeſs like a Saint, liveſt like a devill: in private you'l not deny it.</p>
               <p>Know't, God, of all kindes of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures moſt diſlikes <hi>Harpyes,</hi> which
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:119880:172"/>have <hi>ora virginum, ungues vulturum,</hi> Virgins looks, Vultures clawes.</p>
               <p>Of all kinde of pictures <hi>Nebuchaane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> whoſe head was of gold, armes of filver, belly of braſſe, legs of iron, feet of clay.</p>
               <p>The Ferriman rowes one way, looks another way. It's commendable in his ſea-calling, not in the calling of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <hi>Sodoms</hi> Apples were fair to the eye, but being touch't turned to aſhes.</p>
               <p>O what a miſery is this, to ſeem to be, and not to be!</p>
               <p>Pageants pleaſe ſpectators eyes, you have another to pleaſe, even your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven, who tries the heart and ſearches the reins.</p>
               <p>I approve of a glorious profeſſion, let not that be all, beware of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; a white Devill makes as fair ſhew, and comes to the Church, and as oſt with a white apron, as in a white ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice. Either be what thou ſeemeſt to be, orelſe ſhew thy ſelf in thy own colours. Straight what crookt, converſation, conſcience; that without doors, this within—elſe the one will be odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to man, both to God.</p>
               <p>Bear't in minde, man judges of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:119880:172"/>heart, by thy words and deeds, and thou maiſt decived him: God judges of thy words and actions by thy heart, and him thou canſt not deceive.</p>
               <p>Though ſome of you, amongſt ſo many, it's to be feared, ſome be akin to the Adverb <hi>Quaſi,</hi> as it were but ſuch ſo zealous, yet it's my hopes there's but a few ſuch doſſemblers among you, I ſhould be ſorry there ſhould be above one <hi>Judas</hi> in the houſe of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>A ſecond meditation this Amen gives birthdome: and I thus deduct it from it.</p>
               <p>Amen, which ſignifies Chriſt, is as <hi>a</hi> ſo <hi>w,</hi> as from everlaſting, ſo to laſt, and everlaſtingly. Parallel thy prayer with its Author, yea ſample the one by the other, there is no end of him, let there be no end of thine: O pray continually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mane</hi> the verb gives us it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>Let us hold out our prayers as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did his ſpear, lift up our voice unto the Lord as <hi>Moſes</hi> did his hand, let the waters of <hi>Eloim</hi> be our prayers embleme, ever overflowing; let the continue moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sun, move us continually to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:119880:173"/>move in the ſphere of prayer.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould I not lengthen my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to God, ſince Gods calling on me and ſo oft, ere I would give heed, aſſures me, I ſhall not be heard for a word, when I call on him: God hath cal'd on us a thouſand times, and we would never hear him, turn'd deaf ear to him, and think we to have God at a whiſtle when we call?</p>
               <p>Too much we take upon us, too little we ſet by the Lord: ſhall we be ſo coy? Why then ſhould he be ſo kinde? He cals, we care not; and for a call, is there cauſe for us to exact his audience?</p>
               <p>Duſt and aſhes is too preſumptuous, to deny ſo oft, to expect an anſwer and for no more. Muſt we turn deaf ear to God, and muſt God be bound to hear us for a word? With the ſweat of our browes we are to earn our bread? And for a word and away, think we to get bread of life of the Lord of life? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unworthy wretches, let the ſeptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate ſound of the Trumpets, prompt us on to lift up our voice like a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to the Lord, and aloud and oft. The fearfull Hare, for the ſafegard of her life, makes many doubles; doubra
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:119880:173"/>leſſe there muſt be doubling of our Prayers, to winde us our of danger of death: and Death ſtand we not in awe of thee? I fear not to die, but to dye eternally; which let my prayers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe as the waters did under the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of the Temple, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. Then will I not doubt by this ſea of deep ſounding ſupplications to be ferried over, and ſet a ſhore at the gates of New Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>I come to a ſecond Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hold out your prayers, ſince its importunity will prevail. Have you not heard, if one word will not, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond onſet may do it, if not a ſecond, a third. O! continuall droppings of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, can cauſe Gods heart thou haſt hardned againſt thee, give again. <hi>Gutta cavat lapidem,</hi> the ſtone is hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inceſſant drops: the unjuſt judge is move with the importunity of the poor widow, ſhee's not heard at firſt, cries again, again neglected, and again cries out upon the unrighteous judge, whoſe ears ſo much ſhe troubles, for her cauſe he never weighs, till all he begs he grants.</p>
               <p>That the parable imports is, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:119880:174"/>ſeldome gets a may ſay; and if not with the unrighteous Judge, much leſſe with the Judge of heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is it hath made me reſolve upon it, to fall to prayers again, and if I gain not what I goe about, not to let God reſt at quiet till my ſuit be ſigned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This is Gods own counſell, pray continually, what ſhall his counſell be no command? a ſhame ſo much ſhould be injoyned, and ſo little done: here is a long task, and a lazie genration, ſome never laying their hands to this labour, I mean praying in private nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their private families, nor in their private cloſets. Some diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to joyne with us in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayers, I mean in the Church in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: What's the cauſe? Where's the defect? wherein ſmell they either of Hereſie or Superſtition? would God any loved me ſo well they would tell me, and where and wherein; I am not ſo obſtinate, but I would give him hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and thanks if he deſerve it— In time I may meet with ſuch a <hi>Goliah,</hi> but I truſt I need not fear his weavers beam.</p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:119880:174"/>
               <p> But as for thoſe cry out of all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted prayers, I cannot but cry out of them, and tell them to their teeths, while they cry out of ſuperſtition in many things they are too ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and in ſpeciall, while they imagine there's no printed prayer meet to have an Amen, but it made, and extemporary.</p>
               <p>I have heard of two ſorts of prayers have been mightily diſcommended by a Sect ſuppoſe themſelves none-ſuch, and I would be ſorry to be ſuch as they are. Prayer in print for private uſe, our printed prayers uſed in publick.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, what thinkeſt thou all have the gift of prayer? There's one ſpirit, but divers gifts, every one, the Text plain it hath not all of them, what then muſt he do, wants the gift of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf to God by prayer: theſe humorous heads debar ſuch poor ſouls from pen'd prayers, and leave them in a worſe caſe than the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims leſt the Iſraelites, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to whet their blunted goads and mattocks.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, Church prayers; why reliſheſt thou not a pew-prayer, as well
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:119880:175"/>as a pulpit-prayer? O! the ones in print, but the other is pend, and by the ſpirit. I tell thee, and note it, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary pulpit-prayer made by the Miniſter in reſpect of thee, is a ſet form of prayer: and my reaſon to prove it is this, for that thy ſpirit is bound to ſay, Amen, to what he hath dictated.</p>
               <p>And now ſince both are ſet forms in reſpect of the people, this ith' pulpit, that ith' pew, why maiſt not thou ſay Amen as well to Church-prayers made by many gracious choice Divines, as to an extemporary prayer made by ſome one, ſometime, who it may be ſpeaks non-ſenſe to God Almighty.</p>
               <p>I profeſſe I pity the ſullen humour of our times, and a ſect who delight themſelves with nought but new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; as all that know me, know I hate a very rag of Idolatry: So I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the ſick-brainneſſe of divers of this age, who are faln into a frenzy of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by doing wrong, and of purging out, of our Church—Nay ſome are grown ſo impudently devout, that they dare ſay it, it's not meet to ſay our Lords prayer—</p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:119880:175"/>
               <p> Lord what impure purity is this, for fleſh and bloud to give a <hi>non placet,</hi> to that Chriſt hath given under his own hand, it fit to go for currant, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2.</p>
               <p>It ſhall be my prayers that God 0 would root out of old <hi>England,</hi> all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and all conceited Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who take ſcare both at our Lords Prayer, and divers other godly prayers of—</p>
               <p>Our Lords prayer is authoriſed to be ſaid by one of the three States of Heaven, and what one ſays, all aſſent to. The other, our Common-prayers have been allowed of by our three States of Parliament, once the reputed nerves and ſinews of our nation.</p>
               <p>All the Members of which, when they meet, the Lord grant in all things which concern this his Church, they may be directed by his holy Spirit. And to this in a peaceable way to agree, let all true hearted natives ſay Amen.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to end all with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Contemplation upon <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All our prayers are Epitomized in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:119880:176"/>our Lords Prayer, and our Lords Prayer in this one, Amen. How ſoon is it ſaid? how much doth it comprehend? I had need take good heed, when I pray. And have I not as much need to minde, when I end with this, Amen. I have been a long time unfolding my minde to God: this Amen, is that one, which when I have opened it, claſpes it up.</p>
               <p>Have you not ſeen a book in quires, after that bound up: ſuch is every ſingle petition, ſuch an one is this, Amen. What in them laid ſevered, in this is bound up.</p>
               <p>The petitions in our Lords prayer, are much like the verſes of a Pſalme whoſe tune is prick it briefs and ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briefs? Amen ſet at end, is the quickeſt ſemi-quaver Time, and a well pleaſing note in the ears of God Almighty—my petitioning Epiſtle I have put up to God: that is, my Prayer; the Collect of it is, Amen.</p>
               <p>You know there are abundance of ſacred truths beleeved by us Chriſtians, and yet their Encheridion is our Creed, in like ſort, here is a world of good we beg of God, yet all ſum'd up in this Amen.</p>

               <p>But come, when we have made long prayers, are they all comprehended in our Lords prayer? When we have ſaid our Lords prayer, is it breviated in this its laſt word?</p>
               <p>It makes me I dare not at all times give the <hi>plaudite</hi> to long prayers, nor over cenſure decurt devotion: the moſt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119880:177"/>is not ever the beſt; let my prayer be of the beſt, and God will be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with my little, though I ſay no more. Nor ſpeak I this to leſſen devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to comfort thoſe who are not ſo fully gifted. God may be in thy heart, though thy tongue be not ſo long, and the Publican be accepted with his ſhort when the Phariſee, his Long, ſhall be little ſet by.</p>
               <p>Amen, ſet at end of our prayers and devoutly uttered, ſounds better in Gods ears than vain tautologies.</p>
               <p>The Hypocrite hath more tongue than heart; the child of God more heart than tongue. Yet O Lord untie the ſtrings of my tongue, and my lips ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe. Yet ſince thou loveſt not much vain babling, ſet thou a watch before my tongue, that I offend not with my lips.</p>
